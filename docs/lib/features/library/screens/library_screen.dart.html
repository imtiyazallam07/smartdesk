                <p>This file manages the <strong>Library Book Lifecycle</strong>. It interfaces with
                    <code>LibraryDatabaseHelper</code> for CRUD operations on book records. It includes a built-in
                    notification scheduler that sets alerts for 7, 3, and 1 day(s) before the book's due date using the
                    local notification plugin.</p>

                <p>This is your <strong>Digital Library Shelf</strong>. When you borrow a book, you add it here. The app
                    then acts like a helpful librarian who quietly reminds you several times before the book is due, so
                    you never have to pay a late fine again.</p>
